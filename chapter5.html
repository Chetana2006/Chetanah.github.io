      <h3>Python-based Data Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Python is one of the most widely used programming languages for data analysis, probability, and statistical computing. Its simplicity, readability, and powerful libraries make it ideal for analyzing data, visualizing results, and performing statistical computations. In Probability and Statistics, Python helps automate calculations, analyze large datasets, and visualize distributions such as binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions.

      <h4>Basics of Python Programming</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Variables and Data Types:</strong> Variables store data values. Python automatically determines the data type.
          <pre>
x = 10          # Integer
y = 3.14        # Float
name = "Data"   # String
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lists and Tuples:</strong> Lists are used to store multiple values such as observations or samples.
          <pre>data = [12, 15, 18, 20, 22]</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Loops:</strong> Loops help perform repetitive operations like calculating frequencies.
          <pre>
for value in data:
    print(value)
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Functions:</strong> Functions help organize reusable code.
          <pre>
def mean(data):
    return sum(data)/len(data)
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Data Cleaning & Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        Remove errors and visualize data using graphs for insights. In Probability and Statistics, raw data collected from real-world sources is often incomplete, inconsistent, or noisy. Data cleaning ensures data quality, while data visualization helps in understanding distributions, trends, and patterns. Python provides powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform efficient data cleaning and visualization.
      </p>

      <h3>Histogram & Boxplot Generation</h3>
      <p>
        Used to understand data distributions visually. Graphical representation of data is essential in Probability and Statistics to understand distribution, spread, and variability of data. Two important graphical tools are the Histogram and the Box Plot.
      </p>

      <h3>Hypothesis Testing Using Real Data</h3>
      <p>
        Apply tests like t-test or chi-square to real datasets. Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions about a population parameter based on sample information. In real-world applications, data collected from industries, experiments, or surveys is used to verify claims. In this example, we apply a Z-test for mean using real production data from a manufacturing company.
