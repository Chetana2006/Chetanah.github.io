  <h2>Chapter 1: Description of Data</h2>

  <h3>1. Introduction to Data</h3>
  <p>
    Data refers to a collection of facts, figures, observations, or measurements
    collected for analysis. In statistics, data is used to understand patterns,
    make decisions, and draw conclusions about real-world situations.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Types of Variables</h3>
  <p>
    Variables are characteristics that can take different values.
    They are broadly classified into:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Qualitative Variables:</b> Non-numerical data such as gender, color, or category.</li>
    <li><b>Quantitative Variables:</b> Numerical data such as height, weight, or marks.</li>
    <li><b>Discrete Variables:</b> Countable values (e.g., number of students).</li>
    <li><b>Continuous Variables:</b> Measurable values (e.g., time, temperature).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Mean</h3>
  <p>
    The mean is the average of a set of observations. It is calculated by dividing
    the sum of all values by the total number of observations.
  </p>
  <p><b>Formula:</b> Mean = (Sum of observations) / (Number of observations)</p>

  <h3>4. Weighted Mean</h3>
  <p>
    The weighted mean is an average where each value is multiplied by its
    corresponding weight. It is useful when all observations do not have equal importance.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Median</h3>
  <p>
    The median is the middle value of an ordered data set. It divides the data
    into two equal parts.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Mode</h3>
  <p>
    The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set.
    A data set may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Quartiles</h3>
  <p>
    Quartiles divide the data into four equal parts.
    The three quartiles are Q1 (lower quartile), Q2 (median), and Q3 (upper quartile).
  </p>

  <h3>8. Variance</h3>
  <p>
    Variance measures how far the data values are spread from the mean.
    A higher variance indicates greater dispersion in the data.
  </p>

  <h3>9. Coefficient of Variation</h3>
  <p>
    The coefficient of variation is a relative measure of dispersion.
    It is expressed as a percentage and compares variability between data sets.
  </p>
  <p><b>Formula:</b> CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100</p>

  <h3>10. Skewness</h3>
  <p>
    Skewness indicates the asymmetry of a distribution.
    A distribution can be positively skewed, negatively skewed, or symmetrical.
  </p>

  <h3>11. Histogram</h3>
  <p>
    A histogram is a graphical representation of frequency distribution
    using contiguous rectangles. It helps visualize the shape of data distribution.
  </p>

  <h3>12. Box Plot</h3>
  <p>
    A box plot is a graphical representation that shows the minimum,
    first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values of a data set.
