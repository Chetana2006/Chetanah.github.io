  <h2>Chapter 2: Probability</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Definition of Probability</h3>
  <p>
    Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will occur.
    It is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total
    number of equally likely outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The value of probability always lies between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates an
    impossible event and 1 indicates a certain event.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Types of Events</h3>
  <p>
    Events are the possible outcomes of a random experiment. The different types
    of events are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simple Event:</strong> An event consisting of a single outcome</li>
    <li><strong>Compound Event:</strong> An event consisting of more than one outcome</li>
    <li><strong>Independent Events:</strong> Events where the occurrence of one does not affect the other</li>
    <li><strong>Dependent Events:</strong> Events where the occurrence of one affects the probability of another</li>
    <li><strong>Mutually Exclusive Events:</strong> Events that cannot occur simultaneously</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3 Addition and Multiplication Rules</h3>
  <p>
    The addition and multiplication rules are used to calculate probabilities
    of combined events.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Addition Rule:</strong>
      The probability that either of two mutually exclusive events occurs is the
      sum of their individual probabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Multiplication Rule:</strong>
      The probability that two independent events occur together is the product
      of their individual probabilities.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.4 Conditional Probability</h3>
  <p>
    Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that
    another event has already occurred.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is denoted as P(A|B) and is calculated using the formula:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)</em>
  </p>

  <h3>2.5 Bayes’ Theorem</h3>
  <p>
    Bayes’ Theorem is used to determine the probability of an event based on
    prior knowledge of related events.
  </p>
  <p>
    It provides a way to update probabilities when new information becomes
    available and is widely used in statistics, data science, and machine learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    The formula for Bayes’ Theorem is:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>P(A|B) = [P(B|A) × P(A)] / P(B)</em>
