<h2>Chapter 3: Random Variables & Distributions</h2>

<h3>Discrete & Continuous Variables</h3>
<p>A random variable is a numerical quantity whose value depends on the outcome of a random experiment. 
  Random variables are used to quantify uncertainty in probabilistic and statistical analysis.
  Random variables are broadly classified into:
 Discrete Random Variables Continuous Random VariablesDiscrete variables have countable values; continuous have infinite values.</p>

<h3>Probability Mass Function (PMF)</h3>
<p>A Probability Mass Function (PMF) describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. 
  It assigns a probability to each possible value the random variable can take.PMFs are widely used in probability theory, statistics, machine learning, queueing theory, and reliability engineering
  .Assigns probabilities to discrete random variables.Mathematical Definition
Let X be a discrete random variable. The Probability Mass Function is defined as:
P(X = x) = f(x)
where:
f(x) ≥ 0 for all x
Σ f(x) = 1 (sum over all possible x)Applications of PMF
🎲 Modeling dice, cards, and lotteries
📊 Discrete probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson)
📦 Quality control and defect analysis
📡 Network packet transmission analysis
🤖 Machine learning (Naïve Bayes models)</p>

<h3>Probability Density Function (PDF)</h3>
<p>Describes probabilities of continuous variables.A Probability Density Function (PDF) describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.
For a continuous random variable X, the probability that X lies between two values a and b is:
P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫ab f(x) dx
f(x) ≥ 0 for all x
∫-∞∞ f(x) dx = 1
P(X = x) = 0 for continuous variablesExample of PDF (Uniform Distribution)
Problem:
Let X be the lifetime (in hours) of a light bulb. Assume X is uniformly distributed between 0 and 10 hours.
PDF:
f(x) = 1/10 ,   0 ≤ x ≤ 10
f(x) = 0 ,   otherwise
Find: P(3 ≤ X ≤ 7)
Solution:
P(3 ≤ X ≤ 7) = ∫37 1/10 dx
= (1/10) × (7 − 3)
= 0.4
✔ Therefore, the probability that the bulb lasts between 3 and 7 hours is 0.4.</p>

<h3>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of a random variable X gives the probability that X takes a value less than or equal to a given number.
It is denoted by F(x) and is defined for both discrete and continuous random variables.Mathematical Definition
F(x) = P(X ≤ x)
For Discrete Random Variable
F(x) = Σ P(X = xᵢ) ,   for all xᵢ ≤ x
For Continuous Random Variable
F(x) = ∫-∞x f(t) dt</h3>
<p>Probability that variable ≤ value.</p>

<h3>Binomial, Poisson & Normal Distributions</h3>
<p>Common distributions used in real data analysis.Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation are fundamental statistical measures used to describe the central tendency and dispersion of a random variable.
These measures are applicable to both discrete and continuous random variables and play a key role in probability distributions.Binomial Distribution
A binomial distribution models the number of successes in n independent trials, each with probability p.
Formulas
Mean: μ = np
Variance: σ² = npq
Standard Deviation: σ = √(npq)
Solved Example
n = 10, p = 0.4
μ = 10 × 0.4 = 4
σ² = 10 × 0.4 × 0.6 = 2.4
σ = √2.4 ≈ 1.55</p>
