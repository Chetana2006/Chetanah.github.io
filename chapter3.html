      <h2>Chapter 3: Random Variables & Distributions</h2>

      <h3>Discrete & Continuous Variables</h3>
      <p>
        A random variable is a numerical quantity whose value depends on the outcome of a random experiment. 
        Random variables are used to quantify uncertainty in probabilistic and statistical analysis.  
        They are broadly classified into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Discrete Random Variables:</strong> Take countable values.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Random Variables:</strong> Take infinite values.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Probability Mass Function (PMF)</h3>
      <p>
        A PMF describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable by assigning a probability to each possible value.
      </p>
      <pre>
Mathematical Definition:
Let X be a discrete random variable.
P(X = x) = f(x)
where:
f(x) ≥ 0 for all x
Σ f(x) = 1  (sum over all possible x)

Applications:
- Modeling dice, cards, and lotteries
- Discrete probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson)
- Quality control and defect analysis
- Network packet transmission analysis
- Machine learning (Naïve Bayes models)
      </pre>

      <h3>Probability Density Function (PDF)</h3>
      <p>
        A PDF describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. For a continuous random variable X:
      </p>
      <pre>
P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫[a to b] f(x) dx
f(x) ≥ 0 for all x
∫[-∞ to ∞] f(x) dx = 1
P(X = x) = 0
      </pre>
      <p><strong>Example (Uniform Distribution):</strong></p>
      <pre>
Problem:
Let X = lifetime of a light bulb (hours), uniformly distributed between 0 and 10.

PDF:
f(x) = 1/10 , 0 ≤ x ≤ 10
f(x) = 0 , otherwise

Find P(3 ≤ X ≤ 7):
P(3 ≤ X ≤ 7) = ∫[3 to 7] 1/10 dx
              = (1/10) × (7 − 3)
              = 0.4

✔ Probability that the bulb lasts between 3 and 7 hours = 0.4
      </pre>

      <h3>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)</h3>
      <p>
        The CDF of a random variable X gives the probability that X takes a value less than or equal to a given number. Denoted as F(x):
      </p>
      <pre>
For Discrete X:
F(x) = Σ P(X = xᵢ), for all xᵢ ≤ x

For Continuous X:
F(x) = ∫[-∞ to x] f(t) dt
      </pre>

      <h3>Binomial, Poisson & Normal Distributions</h3>
      <p>
        Common distributions used in real data analysis. Mean, variance, and standard deviation describe the central tendency and dispersion of a random variable.
      </p>

      <h4>Binomial Distribution</h4>
      <p>
        Models the number of successes in n independent trials, each with probability p.
      </p>
      <pre>
Formulas:
Mean: μ = np
Variance: σ² = npq
Standard Deviation: σ = √(npq)

Example:
n = 10, p = 0.4
μ = 10 × 0.4 = 4
σ² = 10 × 0.4 × 0.6 = 2.4
σ = √2.4 ≈ 1.55
