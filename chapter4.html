<h2>Chapter 4: Statistical Inference</h2>

<h3>Sampling Methods</h3>
<p>Select representative data from a population (Random, Stratified, Systematic)Probability sampling is a method of sampling in which every unit of the population has a known and non-zero probability of being selected.
These methods are widely used in statistics because they produce unbiased and reliable results.Types of Probability Sampling
Simple Random Sampling
Systematic Sampling
Stratified Sampling
Cluster Sampling
.</p>

<h3>Confidence Intervals</h3>
<p>Estimate population parameters with a given confidence level.A confidence interval is a range of values used to estimate an unknown population parameter such as mean or proportion.
It provides an interval within which the true population parameter is expected to lie with a specified level of confidence.Common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%.
General Formula
Confidence Interval = Point Estimate ± Margin of Error
Margin of Error = Critical Value × Standard Erro</p>

<h3>Sample Size Determination</h3>
<p>Calculate how much data is needed for accurate resultsSample size determination is the process of selecting an appropriate number of observations or subjects from a population to ensure reliable and accurate statistical results.
Choosing the correct sample size is essential because:
Too small a sample gives unreliable results
Too large a sample increases cost and time
Correct sample size balances accuracy and efficiency
  Sample Size for Estimating Mean
When estimating a population mean with known standard deviation, the sample size is calculated using the following formula:
n = ( zα/2 · σ / E )²
Where:
n = required sample size
zα/2 = critical value for confidence level
σ = population standard deviation
E = allowable error (margin of error)
example 1: Sample Size for Mean
Given:
Population standard deviation (σ) = 10
Margin of error (E) = 2
Confidence level = 95%
Solution:For 95% confidence level, zα/2 = 1.96
n = (1.96 × 10 / 2)²
n = (9.8)² = 96.04
Required Sample Size:
n ≈ 97 (rounded up).</p>

<h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>
<p>Decision-making process using sample data to accept or reject a hypothesis.</p>

<h3>Z-test & t-test</h3>
<p>Tests used to compare sample and population meansHypothesis testing is a statistical procedure used to make decisions about population parameters based on sample data.
A Z-test is used to test hypotheses about a population mean or proportion when the sample size is large (n ≥ 30) or when the population standard deviation is known.
  When to Use Z-Test
Sample size is large (n ≥ 30)
Population standard deviation (σ) is known
Data is approximately normally distributed
Observations are independent
  When to Use Z-Test
Sample size is large (n ≥ 30)
Population standard deviation (σ) is known
Data is approximately normally distributed
Observations are independent.</p>
