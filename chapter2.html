      <h2>Chapter 2: Probability</h2>

      <h3>Definition of Probability</h3>
      <p>
        Probability is the likelihood that an event will occur (<strong>0 ≤ P ≤ 1</strong>). 
        It is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of equally likely outcomes.
      </p>
      <pre>
Mathematical Definition:
P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes

P(A) = 0 → Event is impossible
P(A) = 1 → Event is certain
0 < P(A) < 1 → Event is uncertain
      </pre>

      <h3>Types of Events</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple Event</li>
        <li>Compound Event</li>
        <li>Independent & Dependent Events</li>
        <li>Mutually Exclusive Events</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Addition & Multiplication Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Probability can be interpreted in different ways depending on the experiment and available information:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Classical Interpretation:</strong> Applies when all outcomes are equally likely.
          <pre>
Formula: P(A) = n(A) / n(S)

Example:
Experiment: Tossing a fair die
Event A: Getting an even number
Favorable outcomes = {2, 4, 6}
Total outcomes = 6
P(A) = 3/6 = 1/2
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Empirical (Relative Frequency) Interpretation:</strong> Probability is the ratio of the number of times an event occurs to the total trials in repeated experiments.
          <pre>
Formula: P(A) = lim (Number of times A occurs / Total trials)

Example:
A machine produces defective items 20 times in 1000 trials
Probability of defect = 20 / 1000 = 0.02
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subjective Interpretation:</strong> Based on personal judgment, experience, or belief.
          <pre>
Example:
Probability of rain tomorrow based on weather forecast = 0.7
Probability of project completion on time based on experience = 0.8
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Applications of Probability</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Risk analysis and reliability engineering</li>
        <li>Machine learning and artificial intelligence</li>
        <li>Network traffic modeling</li>
        <li>Quality control and defect prediction</li>
        <li>Weather forecasting and decision-making</li>
        <li>Financial modeling and investment analysis</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Probability enables informed decisions under uncertainty and optimizes system performance.
        Conditional probability formula: 
        <strong>P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Bayes’ Theorem</h3>
      <p>
        Bayes’ Theorem provides a method for updating the probability of an event based on new information. 
        It is widely used in Bayesian statistics, machine learning, AI, and decision-making systems.
      </p>
      <pre>
Statement:
If A and B are two events such that P(B) ≠ 0, then

P(A | B) = [ P(B | A) × P(A) ] / P(B)

This formula allows computation of the probability of a cause (A) given an observed effect (B).
