<h2>Chapter 2: Probability</h2>

<h3>Definition of Probability</h3>
<p>Probability is the likelihood that an event will occur (0 ≤ P ≤ 1).Probability of an event is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of equally likely outcomes.

Mathematical Definition:

P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes

The value of probability always lies between 0 and 1:

P(A) = 0 → Event is impossible
P(A) = 1 → Event is certain
0 < P(A) < 1 → Event is uncertain</p>

<h3>Types of Events</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simple Event</li>
<li>Compound Event</li>
<li>Independent & Dependent Events</li>
<li>Mutually Exclusive Events</li>
</ul>

<h3>Addition & Multiplication Rules</h3>
<p>Probability can be interpreted in different ways depending on the nature of the experiment and available information. The main interpretations are:

1. Classical Interpretation
This interpretation applies when all outcomes of an experiment are equally likely.

Formula:

P(A) = n(A) / n(S)

Example:

Experiment: Tossing a fair die
Event A: Getting an even number
Favorable outcomes = {2, 4, 6}
Total outcomes = 6
P(A) = 3/6 = 1/2
2. Empirical (Relative Frequency) Interpretation
Probability is defined as the ratio of the number of times an event occurs to the total number of trials, when the experiment is repeated a large number of times.

Formula:

P(A) = lim (Number of times A occurs / Total trials)

Example:

A machine produces defective items 20 times in 1000 trials
Probability of defect = 20 / 1000 = 0.02
3. Subjective Interpretation
Subjective probability is based on personal judgment, experience, or belief rather than mathematical calculation.

Example:

Probability of rain tomorrow based on weather forecast = 0.7
Probability of project completion on time based on experience = 0.8.</p>

<h3>Applications of probability</h3>
<p> Risk analysis and reliability engineering
Machine learning and artificial intelligence
Network traffic modeling
Quality control and defect prediction
Weather forecasting and decision-making
Financial modeling and investment analysis
Probability enables engineers and analysts to make informed decisions under uncertainty and optimize system performance.Probability of an event given another event has occurred: P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B)</p>

<h3>Bayes’ Theorem</h3>
<p>Bayes’ Theorem is a fundamental result in probability theory that provides a method for updating the probability of an event based on new information.
  It relates conditional probabilities of events and allows reverse inference.This theorem forms the backbone of Bayesian statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and decision-making systems.Updates probability based on prior knowledge: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) × P(A)] / P(B)
Statement of Bayes’ Theorem
If A and B are two events such that P(B) ≠ 0, then the conditional probability of A given B is given by:

P(A | B) = [ P(B | A) × P(A) ] / P(B)

This formula allows us to compute the probability of a cause (A) given the observed effect (B).</p>
