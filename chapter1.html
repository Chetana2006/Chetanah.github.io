    <h2>Chapter 1: Description of Data</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Data refers to raw facts and observations collected from experiments,
      surveys, or real-life situations. The main objective of statistics
      is to organize, analyze, and interpret data in order to draw meaningful
      conclusions and support decision-making.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Variables</h3>
    <p>
      Variables represent characteristics that can take different values.
      They are classified into the following types:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Qualitative (Categorical):</strong> Non-numerical data such as gender, color, or category.</li>
      <li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> Numerical data which can be:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Discrete:</strong> Countable values (e.g., number of students).</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous:</strong> Measured values (e.g., height, weight).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mean and Weighted Mean</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>mean</strong> is the arithmetic average of a data set and
      provides a measure of central tendency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>weighted mean</strong> is used when different data values
      have different levels of importance, where weights are assigned
      accordingly.
    </p>

    <h3>Median and Mode</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>median</strong> is the middle value when data is arranged
      in ascending or descending order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>mode</strong> is the value that occurs most frequently
      in the data set.
    </p>

    <h3>Quartiles</h3>
    <p>
      Quartiles divide the data into four equal parts:
      Q1 (lower quartile), Q2 (median), and Q3 (upper quartile).
      They help in understanding the spread and distribution of data.
    </p>

    <h3>Variance</h3>
    <p>
      Variance measures the degree of dispersion of data points from the mean.
      A higher variance indicates that data points are more spread out.
    </p>

    <h3>Coefficient of Variation</h3>
    <p>
      The coefficient of variation (CV) is a relative measure of dispersion.
      It is expressed as:
      <br><strong>CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Skewness</h3>
    <p>
      Skewness describes the symmetry of a data distribution.
      A distribution can be positively skewed, negatively skewed, or symmetric.
    </p>

    <h3>Histogram</h3>
    <p>
      A histogram is a graphical representation of frequency distribution
      using bars. It helps visualize the shape and spread of data.
    </p>

    <h3>Box Plot</h3>
    <p>
      A box plot summarizes data using minimum value, quartiles, median,
      and maximum value. It is useful for detecting outliers.
