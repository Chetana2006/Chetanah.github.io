      <h2>Chapter 1: Description of Data</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Data refers to raw facts and observations collected from experiments, surveys, or real-life situations. 
        The main objective of statistics is to organize, analyze, and interpret data in order to draw meaningful conclusions and support decision-making.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of Variables</h3>
      <p>
        A variable is a characteristic, property, or quantity that can take different values for different observations or over time.
        Variables are classified into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Qualitative (Categorical):</strong> Non-numerical data such as gender, color, or category.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> Numerical data, which can be:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Discrete:</strong> Countable values (e.g., number of students).</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous:</strong> Measured values (e.g., height, weight).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mean and Weighted Mean</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Mean:</strong> The average value of the data, obtained by summing all observations and dividing by the number of observations.
      </p>
      <pre>Mean = (Sum of all observations) / (Number of observations)</pre>

      <p>
        <strong>Weighted Mean:</strong> Each observation is multiplied by a corresponding weight reflecting its importance. 
        The sum of weighted values is divided by the sum of the weights.
      </p>
      <pre>Weighted Mean = (Σ wᵢxᵢ) / (Σ wᵢ)
where xᵢ = observations, wᵢ = weights</pre>

      <h3>Median and Mode</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Median:</strong> Middle value when data is arranged in order. If even number of observations, median is the average of two middle values.
      </p>
      <pre>
Steps:
1. Arrange data in order
2. If n is odd → Median = middle value
3. If n is even → Median = average of two middle values
Example:
Data: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35
Median = 25
      </pre>
      <p>
        For continuous data:
      </p>
      <pre>
Median = l + [( (N/2) − cf ) / f ] × h
Where:
l = lower boundary of median class
N = total frequency
cf = cumulative frequency before median class
f = frequency of median class
h = class width
      </pre>

      <p>
        <strong>Mode:</strong> The value occurring most frequently. Can be unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal.
      </p>
      <pre>
Example (Discrete Data):
Data: 2, 4, 4, 6, 8
Mode = 4

Mode (Continuous Data):
Mode = l + [(f₁ − f₀) / (2f₁ − f₀ − f₂)] × h
Where:
l = lower boundary of modal class
f₁ = frequency of modal class
f₀ = frequency of preceding class
f₂ = frequency of succeeding class
h = class width
      </pre>

      <h3>Quartiles</h3>
      <p>
        Quartiles divide data into four equal parts: Q1 (25%), Q2 (50%, median), Q3 (75%). 
        They help understand the spread and distribution of data.
      </p>

      <h3>Variance</h3>
      <p>
        Variance measures how spread out the data points are from the mean. 
        Higher variance = more spread; lower variance = data closer to mean.
      </p>

      <h3>Coefficient of Variation (CV)</h3>
      <p>
        CV is a relative measure of dispersion: <strong>CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100</strong>. 
        It helps compare variability between datasets with different means.
      </p>

      <h3>Skewness</h3>
      <p>
        Skewness describes the symmetry of data distribution:
        <ul>
          <li>Positive Skewness: Right tail longer; mean > median > mode.</li>
          <li>Negative Skewness: Left tail longer; mean < median < mode.</li>
          <li>Zero Skewness: Symmetric distribution.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Histogram</h3>
      <p>
        A histogram is a bar graph representing frequency distribution of continuous data. 
        Class intervals are on x-axis; frequency is on y-axis.
      </p>
      <pre>
Example:
Marks: 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80
Intervals (width 10):
40–50: 2
50–60: 3
60–70: 3
70–80: 2
      </pre>

      <h3>Box Plot</h3>
      <p>
        A box plot (box-and-whisker) summarizes data using five-number summary: minimum, Q1, median (Q2), Q3, maximum.
      </p>
      <pre>
Example:
Data: 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45
Min = 10, Q1 = 20, Median = 30, Q3 = 40, Max = 45
      </pre>
