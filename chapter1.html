    <h2>Chapter 1: Description of Data</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Data refers to raw facts and observations collected from experiments,
      surveys, or real-life situations. The main objective of statistics
      is to organize, analyze, and interpret data in order to draw meaningful
      conclusions and support decision-making.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Variables</h3>
    <p>
      A variable is a characteristic, property, or quantity that can take different values for different observations or over time.
      Variables are used in statistics to represent data that can change and be measured or classified during data collection and analysis.
      They are classified into the following types:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Qualitative (Categorical):</strong> Non-numerical data such as gender, color, or category.</li>
      <li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> Numerical data which can be:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Discrete:</strong> Countable values (e.g., number of students).</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous:</strong> Measured values (e.g., height, weight).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mean and Weighted Mean</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>mean</strong> The mean is a measure of central tendency obtained by adding all the observations in a data set and dividing the sum by the total number of observations.
      It represents the average value of the data.

Formula:
Mean = (Sum of all observations) / (Number of observations)
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>weighted mean</strong>The weighted mean is a measure of central tendency in which each observation is multiplied by a corresponding weight that reflects its importance. 
      The sum of these weighted values is divided by the sum of the weights.

Formula:
Weighted Mean = (Σ wᵢxᵢ) / (Σ wᵢ)

where xᵢ are the observations and wᵢ are their respective weights.
    </p>

    <h3>Median and Mode</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>median</strong> is the middle value when data is arranged
      in ascending or descending order.The median is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value of a data set when the observations are arranged in ascending or descending order. 
      If the number of observations is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>mode</strong> is the value that occurs most frequently
      in the data set.The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set.
      A data set may have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all.
    </p>

    <h3>Quartiles</h3>
    <p>
      Quartiles divide the data into four equal parts:
      Q1 (lower quartile), Q2 (median), and Q3 (upper quartile).
      They help in understanding the spread and distribution of data.Quartiles are measures of position that divide an ordered data set into four equal parts. 
      Each part represents one-fourth (25%) of the total data.
      First Quartile (Q1): The value below which 25% of the observations lie.
      Second Quartile (Q2): The median of the data; 50% of the observations lie below this value.
      Third Quartile (Q3): The value below which 75% of the observations lie.
      Quartiles help in understanding the spread and distribution of data.
    </p>

    <h3>Variance</h3>
    <p>
      Variance measures the degree of dispersion of data points from the mean.
      A higher variance indicates that data points are more spread out.Variance is a measure of dispersion that indicates how far the observations in a data set are spread out from the mean. 
      It is calculated as the average of the squared differences between each observation and the mean.A higher variance shows that the data values are more spread out, while a lower variance indicates that the data values are closer to the mean.
    </p>

    <h3>Coefficient of Variation</h3>
    <p>
      The Coefficient of Variation is a relative measure of dispersion that expresses the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean. 
      It is used to compare the degree of variation between different data sets, even when their means are different.

Formula:
Coefficient of Variation (CV) = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100

A higher CV indicates greater variability in the data, while a lower CV indicates more consistency.
      The coefficient of variation (CV) is a relative measure of dispersion.
      It is expressed as:
      <br><strong>CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Skewness</h3>
    <p>
      Skewness describes the symmetry of a data distribution.
      A distribution can be positively skewed, negatively skewed, or symmetric.Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of data around its mean. 
      It indicates whether the data distribution is symmetric or skewed to the left or right.
      Positive Skewness: The right tail is longer; mean > median > mode.
      Negative Skewness: The left tail is longer; mean < median < mode.

Zero Skewness: The distribution is symmetric.
    </p>

    <h3>Histogram</h3>
    <p>
      A histogram is a graphical representation of frequency distribution
      using bars. It helps visualize the shape and spread of data.A histogram is a graphical representation of the frequency distribution of a continuous data set.
      It uses adjacent rectangles (bars) to show the number of observations falling within specified class intervals.
      The width of each bar represents the class interval, and the height represents the frequency.
    </p>

    <h3>Box Plot</h3>
    <p>
      A box plot summarizes data using minimum value, quartiles, median,
      and maximum value. It is useful for detecting outliers.
      A box plot is a graphical method used to display the distribution of data based on the five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It helps in identifying the spread, central value, and presence of outliers in the data.
